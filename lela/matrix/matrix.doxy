/** \defgroup matrix lela/matrix
 These matrix representations provide iterators for element access.

The class LELA::DenseMatrixBase provides an archetype for matrices that are
"directly represented", that is, where the user has direct access to
iterators over the rows and columns, and to all of the elements themselves
by position. 

The class LELA::SparseMatrixBase provides an archetype for matrices that are
partially "directly represented", that is, where the user has direct access to
(sparse) iterators over the rows and columns, and to all of the nonzero elements 
themselves by position. 

The directly represented matrices are pure containers; they provide no matrix
arithmetic and do not implement the black box interface (but this is added
in their counterparts LELA::DenseMatrix and LELA::SparseMatrix in \ref blackbox) 
They are
parameterized solely by element type. The field is not necessary.

Matrices in general may omit one of the iterators, either the row iterator or
the column iterator. This is useful for, e.g. sparse matrices that are
represented by sparse row vectors, since column vectors are computationally
expensive to compute without directly building the transpose of the matrix.

The class \link LELA::MatrixDomain MatrixDomain \endlink provides a 
complete suite of matrix arithmetic
that works transparently with any class meeting the interface defined by the
classes below. This includes matrix-matrix addition and multiplication,
matrix-vector multiplication, and matrix-blackbox
(c.f. \link LELA::BlackboxArchetype BlackboxArchetype \endlink ) multiplication.
