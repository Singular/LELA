 * condition, all arithmetic in this library is reentrant
 *
 * Contexts are parametrised by Modules, which indicate which

/** Notes on structure of low-level interface
 *
 * Each BLAS-routine has its own class whose name is the name of the
 * routine preceeded by an underscore. Within the routine is a single
 * static method called op. The classes are parametrised by ring and
 * an empty structure called ModulesTag, which can be retrieved from a
 * Modules-class with Modules::Tag. The method is then parametrised
 * normally by Modules (whose tag need not be ModulesTag, in case
 * ModulesTag refers to a less specialised implementation) and the
 * vector- and matrix-types.
 *
 * To create a specialised implementation or a higher level algorithm,
 * just create the corresponding Modules class with an empty Tag and
 * partially specialise the corresponding class to that tag. If the
 * implementation only works with a given ring, then the class may
 * also be specialised to the corresponding ring.
 *
 * The default implementation of the method op simply retrieves the
 * parent of the tag (accessible via ModulesTag::Parent) and invokes
 * the same method with the same operations on the corresponding class
 * instanted with that tag. This permits that a given module,
 * identified by a certain ModulesTag, need not implement all
 * BLAS-routines -- when it fails to implement a routine, a call to
 * that routine is just passed to the parent.
 *
 * The reason to put these methods into classes, as opposed to using
 * naked functions, is to ensure that the correct specialisation is
 * always invoked. Otherwise the compiler may in some cases (which are
 * notoriously tricky and hard to predict) actually prefer a more
 * generic parametrised method to a more specialised one, perhaps even
 * invoking the most generic method in a never ending recursion.
 *
 * When a method must be further specified by, say, vector-type or
 * matrix-iterator-type, these specialisations should appear as
 * private static methods invoked by the method op.
