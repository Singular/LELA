/** \defgroup ring lela/ring

\brief %LELA rings, ring-wrappers, ring-construction-tools.

%LELA fields implement the concept
which is specified in the field archetype.  

Some implement a basic ring concept rather than a field
(inv and div are partial functions).  Ring representations with 
additional functions are also found in the \ref ring directory.
