    * and its encapsulated field element, respectively.
    * %FieldAbstract  then uses virtual member functions to
    * define operations on its encapsulated field element.  This field 
    * element has no knowledge of the field properties being used on it 
    * which means the field object must supply these operations.

    * whenever necessary, although it might be beneficial from an efficiency
    * stand point to include them.  However, because of archetype use three,
    * the elements themselves cannot be contained, but rather pointers to them.
