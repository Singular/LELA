\brief The C-style wrapper of BLAS for finite field linear algebra.

FFLAS, Finite Field Linear Algebra Subroutines, provide basic linear algebra subroutines based on 
the BLAS interface. Therefore, the specifications are in C style; only the field given as a 
template parameter requires C++.

As much as possible, these routines use ATLAS/BLAS computations and achieve therefore high 
efficiency.
