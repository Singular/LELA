/** \brief Random field element generator archetype.
 *
 * This encapsulated class is a generator of random field elements for 
 * the encapsulating field.
 * It is required to contain constructors from a field object and
 * two integers.  The first integer being a cardinality of a set to 
 * draw the random elements from, and the second being a seed for the 
 * random number generator.
 * It is also required to contain a copy constructor, a destructor, and
 * an operator () which acts on a reference to a field element.  In this 
 * operator (), the random element is placed into the input field element 
 * and also returned as a reference.
