/** \brief field base class.
 *  \ingroup field
 *
 * Found in the file \URL{linbox/field/abstract.h}.
 * Abstract base class used to implement the field archetype to minimize
 * code bloat.  All public member functions of this class are purely
 * virtual and must be implemented by all derived classes.
 *
 * If a template is instantiated on the field archetype, we can change the
 * field it is using by changing the derived class of this class.  This allows
 * us to change the field used in a template without having to reinstantiate
 * it.  This minimizes code bloat, but it also introduces indirection through
 * the use of pointers and virtual functions which is inefficient.
