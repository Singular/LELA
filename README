Library for Exact Linear Algebra (LELA)
=======================================

LELA is a C++ template-library for computations in (normally) exact
linear algebra. It is flexible in two respects:
  - the choice of ring over which to compute
  - the choice of vector- and matrix-representation, i.e. dense vs. sparse

LELA uses C++ templates to provide the best feasible performance for
each of the above choices. It also includes wrappers for some other
libraries, such as M4RI (see http://m4ri.sourceforge.net/) and CBLAS
to make use of highly specialised implementations available in certain
cases. All of these dependencies are optional; if the libraries are
not present, LELA will fall back to its own routines at a cost of some
performance.

An introductory tutorial on the use of LELA may be found in the file
doc/tutorial.html

LELA was originally derived from LinBox (see http://www.linalg.org/).
